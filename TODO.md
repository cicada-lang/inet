# example

`examples/combinators.inet` -- interaction combinators
`examples/lambda.inet` -- use interaction combinators

# module system

use `module/name` syntax

- we already using use name such as `@wire/pair`,
  thus module syntax should just map name like `module/name` to value.

# primitive value

[question] how to find rule?

- [maybe] by type -- `(node)-[primitive-value: type]`
  - can not use type, because type is complicated compound data.

- [maybe] by predicate `(node)-[primitive-value: predicate?]`

  - the builtin primitive functions + builtin primitive datatypes,
    (without interaction nets) forms a forth-like language.

  - a primitive function is generic in the sense that,
    if it is applied to a wire (not-yet-value in NbE),
    it will build a eliminatior node.

[question] is it possible to have a generic `@dup` that can dup any net with a root wire?

`value_t` as sumtype with `WIRE_VALUE` -- every value is under a pointer

[design] write `list-map` as example

- use explicit `@dup` -- keep linear variable like `(<node>)-<port>` simple
- use `{ ... }` for un-named program -- just program, no closure over linear variables

[design] node ports can store any value -- not only wire, but also primitive values

[example] polish parsing (from 1990-interaction-nets) as an example -- need primitive string type

[question] is it possible to have a generic `@dup` that can dup any net with a root wire?

# parallelism

learn linux thread

keep a single thread debug mode, which record all the allocated nodes.
