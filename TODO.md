`definition_t` as -- dynamic tagged union
`program_definition_t` v.s. `node_definition_t`
`op_exe_t` -- has `program_definition_t`
`stack_t` -- like `list`, be a generic data structure
`frame_t` -- as current nodes
`op_fpt_t` -- fix structure
`worker_t` -- has `frame_stack`
`rule_t` -- has `program_t`
`mod_t` -- has `rule_list`

  use list first, optimize only when needed.

`op_run`
`worker_interact`
`worker_run`

test -- build mod by hand and run by worker
